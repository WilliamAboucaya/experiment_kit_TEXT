# Fine-tuned RoBERTa Model for Goal Type Classification

## Model Description
This model is a fine-tuned version of RoBERTa-large for classifying verb-context pairs into one of four goal types: **ACHIEVE, MAINTAIN, AVOID, CEASE**.

## Training Data
The model was trained on a dataset containing verbs and their corresponding contexts, labeled according to their goal types.
